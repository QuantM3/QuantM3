# QuantM3
The quantitative microscopy, microfluidics, and metabolism (QuantM3) lab develops and applies a wide variety of fluorescence microscopy techniques and bioengineering tools to measure tissue molecular physiology. We focus on understanding islet biology in the context of Type 1 (transplantation) and Type 2 diabetes (dysfunction).
